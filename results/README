This directory contains speed test result data from different computers and
distributions that are available to me. This file contains a description of the
test environments. All tests were run with a minimal set of process (usually
just a shell) running in background. Tests were performed 2008-02-26 and
2008-02-27.

*** p4-3200 ***

is an Intel Pentium 4 clocked at 3.2 GHz. It has four different distributions
installed:

*** p4-3200-gentoo ***

is the installed base distribution. The speedtest was performed using the
following ebuilt library versions. All where compiled using portage with:

CFLAGS="-march=i686 -O3 -pipe"
CXXFLAGS="${CFLAGS}"

ebuild package versions used in speedtest:

dev-libs/libgcrypt-1.4.0-r1
dev-libs/libmcrypt-2.5.8
dev-libs/botan-1.6.1-r1
dev-libs/crypto++-5.5.2
dev-libs/nettle-1.15
dev-libs/openssl-0.9.8g
dev-libs/beecrypt-4.1.2-r1
dev-libs/libtomcrypt-1.06

The speedtest source itself was compiled using:

sys-devel/gcc-4.1.2

gcc (GCC) 4.1.2 20070214 (  (gdc 0.24, using dmd 1.020)) (Gentoo 4.1.2 p1.0.2)

*** p4-3200-debian-etch ***

is a chroot-installed Debian etch (currently the stable) distribution. The
following libraries were taken from the standard distribution packages:

package			version

libgcrypt11		1.2.3-2
libgcrypt11-dev		1.2.3-2
libmcrypt4		2.5.7-5
libmcrypt-dev		2.5.7-5
libcrypto++5.2c2a	5.2.1c2a-3
libcrypto++-dev		5.2.1c2a-3
libnettle2		1.14.1-1
libnettle-dev		1.14.1-1
libssl0.9.8		0.9.8c-4etch1
libssl-dev		0.9.8c-4etch1
libbeecrypt6		4.1.2-6
libbeecrypt6-dev	4.1.2-6

Two libraries were not available in the distribution:

Botan was backported to sarge by compiling the version available in lenny:

libbotan1.6		1.6.3-4
libbotan1.6-dev		1.6.3-4

Libtomcrypt is currently not included in Debian lenny, however a new package
which is being prepared for inclusion in Debian is available from:

http://lists.debian.org/debian-mentors/2007/05/msg00275.html

deb-src http://mentors.debian.net/debian unstable main contrib non-free

libtomcrypt0		1.17-1
libtomcrypt0-dev	1.17-1

This source package was compiled in Debian etch.

The speedtest source itself was compiled using:

gcc			4.1.1-15

gcc (GCC) 4.1.2 20061115 (prerelease) (Debian 4.1.1-21)

*** p4-3200-debian-lenny ***

is a chroot-installed Debian lenny (currently the testing) distribution. The
following libraries were taken from the standard distribution packages:

package			version

libgcrypt11		1.4.0-3
libgcrypt11-dev 	1.4.0-3
libmcrypt4		2.5.7-5
libmcrypt-dev		2.5.7-5
libcrypto++7		5.5.2-1
libcrypto++-dev 	5.5.2-1
libbotan1.6		1.6.3-4
libbotan1.6-dev 	1.6.3-4
libnettle2		1.15-4
libnettle-dev		1.15-4
libssl0.9.8		0.9.8g-4
libssl-dev		0.9.8g-4
libbeecrypt6		4.1.2-6
libbeecrypt6-dev	4.1.2-6

Again libtomcrypt was not available via the standard packages. The proposed
package source stated about was recompiled on Debian lenny:

libtomcrypt0		1.17-1
libtomcrypt0-dev	1.17-1

The speedtest source itself was compiled using:

gcc			4:4.2.2-2

gcc (GCC) 4.2.3 (Debian 4.2.3-1)

*** p4-3200-ubuntu-gutsy ***

is a chroot-installed Ubuntu 7.10 Gutsy Gibbon (currently the stable)
distribution. The following libraries were taken from the standard distribution
packages:

package			version

libgcrypt11		1.2.4-2ubuntu2
libgcrypt11-dev		1.2.4-2ubuntu2
libmcrypt4		2.5.7-5
libmcrypt-dev		2.5.7-5
libcrypto++6		5.5-3
libcrypto++-dev		5.5-3
libnettle2		1.15-4
libnettle-dev		1.15-4
libssl0.9.8		0.9.8e-5ubuntu3.1
libssl-dev		0.9.8e-5ubuntu3.1
libbeecrypt6		4.1.2-6build1
libbeecrypt6-dev	4.1.2-6build1

The only library not available in the Ubuntu distribution is Libtomcrypt. This
was taken from the proposed binary packages from
http://ppa.launchpad.net/pgquiles/ubuntu/pool/main/libt/libtomcrypt/

libtomcrypt0		1.17-0ubuntu1~ppa2
libtomcrypt0-dev	1.17-0ubuntu1~ppa2

The speedtest source itself was compiled using:

gcc			4:4.1.2-9ubuntu2

gcc (GCC) 4.1.3 20070929 (prerelease) (Ubuntu 4.1.2-16ubuntu2)

*** p3-1000-ubuntu-gutsy ***

is an Intel Pentium 3 Mobile clocked at 1.0 GHz. The installed base
distribution is (K)Ubuntu 7.10 Gutsy Gibbon (currently the stable).

The configuration and all packages are the same as for p4-3200-ubuntu-gutsy.

*** p2-300-debian-etch ***

is an older Intel Pentium 2 (Klamath) clocked at 300 MHz. The installed base
distribution is Debian etch (currently the stable) distribution.

The configuration and all packages are the same as for p4-3200-debian-etch.
